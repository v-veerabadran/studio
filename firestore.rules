/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership security model for a user profile
 * management application. It is designed for rapid prototyping, focusing on
 * strong authorization while maintaining flexibility in the data schema.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is centered around the principle that users have complete
 * and exclusive control over their own data. All data is scoped to the
 * authenticated user, and no user can read, write, or even list the data of
 * any other user.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: A UserProfile document.
 * - /hospitals/{hospitalId}: Publicly readable hospital information.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Publicly readable doctor information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Ownership: All access control checks verify that the authenticated
 *   user's UID (`request.auth.uid`) matches the `userId` in the document path.
 * - Public Data: Hospital and doctor data is public and read-only for all users.
 * - No User Enumeration: The ability to list all documents in the `/users`
 *   collection is explicitly disabled to protect user privacy and prevent data
 *   scraping. Users can only fetch their own profile document directly by its ID.
 * - Write Integrity: On creation, the rules ensure that the `id` field inside a
 *   user's profile document matches their UID. This field is then enforced as
 *   immutable on all subsequent updates, ensuring a permanent and reliable link
 *   between the document data and its owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset relies on the document's ID (`userId`) as the primary source of
 * truth for ownership, which is the most direct and performant method. It also
 * validates an `id` field inside the document against the path to ensure data
 * integrity, a form of denormalization that solidifies the ownership link.
