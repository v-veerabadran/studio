The structure prioritizes path-based ownership for user profiles, ensuring secure and scalable data access. By placing user profiles directly under `/users/{userId}`, we leverage Firebase's security rules to easily control access based on the authenticated user's ID. This design avoids the need for complex authorization logic or hierarchical dependencies, promoting atomic operations and simplified debugging. The structure segregates user profile data into a dedicated collection, which simplifies security rules by ensuring all documents within the collection share the same security requirements. This eliminates the risk of mixing data with different access needs and further enhances security."
